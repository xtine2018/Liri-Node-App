# Liri-Node-App

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.
